Dandelion is a method designed to build expanded database beyond equilibrium states by sampling reactive chemical space. Our approach provides an automated method to generate
sufficient dataset for training general Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIP) to enhance their performance. To sample chemical space efficiently, our method leverages a tight-binding approach to search for possible reaction pathways on the potential energy surface, and selectively applies high-level calculations. For required high-level calculation, we use ORCA, an external quantum chemistry program. This documentation aims to provide a guide for the installation, setup, and use of Dandelion.
