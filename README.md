### Setup conda environment

This creates a new Conda environment using the specifications provided in `environment.yml` file.

```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ts
pip install -e .
```

### Install pyGSM

Visit the [pyGSM repository](https://github.com/ZimmermanGroup/pyGSM) for instructions or simply use:

```python
git clone https://github.com/ZimmermanGroup/pyGSM
pip install -e .
```
By executing `gsm` in terminal, you can verify that the program has been successfully installed.

### Install Orca

You can install ORCA [here](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal).
This extracts a tar.xz file.

```python
tar -xf orca.tar.xz
```
By executing `orca` in terminal, you can verify that the program has been successfully downloaded.

### Setup environment variables in `.bashrc`

You can open your `.bashrc` file using:
```python
vi ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` file:

1. Add ORCA to your path :
```python
export PATH="/path/to/your/orca/directory:$PATH" \
```

2. Set the `PYTHONPATH` for pyGSM:
```python
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/pyGSM/directory:$PYTHONPATH \
```

3. Adjust the `OMP_NUM_THREADS`:
```python
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
```

4. Set the xtb configuration:
```python
export OMP_STACKSIZE=16G \
ulimit -s unlimited\
```

Apply the changes:
```python
source ~/.bashrc
```
