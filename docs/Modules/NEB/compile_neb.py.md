# compile_neb.py
This code compiles reaction data into '.h5' file. It reads input paths, extracts information on  reactants, transition states, and products, including positions, energies, and forces. The data is stored in the .h5 file. This process can help organize and prepare NEB path data for further analysis efficiently.
