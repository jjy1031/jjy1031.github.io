# filter_neb.py

Filter out NEB jobs and sample geometries for refinement. This algorithm extracts caculated energy, and checks if the reaction is valid. Also, it counts the number of significant imaginary frequencies below the threshold and determines whether a given structure is a proper transition state or not.
