# 1.1. opt_mothers.py


For your crude input structures, this module performs geometry optimization to generate mother structures. The ASE calculator object uses GFN2-xTB, a semi-empirical quantum mechanical method and the optimization is performed by using BFGS algorithm. This can provide stable molecular configurations as a starting point.
